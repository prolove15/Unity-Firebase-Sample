# Firebase Remote Config Quickstart

The Firebase Remote Config Unity Sample demonstrates retrieval of various
data types from
[Firebase Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/)
using the
[Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup).


## Requirements

* [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) 5.3 or higher.
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 9.4.1 or higher
  (when developing for iOS).
* [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads)
  (when developing for Android).


## Building the Sample

### iOS

  - Register your iOS app with Firebase.
    - Create a project in the
      [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      and associate your iOS application.
      - You should use `com.google.firebase.unity.remoteconfig.testapp` as the
        package name while you're testing.
        - If you do not use the prescribed package name you will need to update
          the bundle identifier as described in the
          `Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier` below.
    - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file associated with your
      Firebase project from the console.
      This file identifies your iOS app to the Firebase backend, and will
      need to be included in the sample later.
    - For further details please refer to the
      [general instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
      which describes how to configure a Firebase application for iOS.
  - Download the
    [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity)
    and unzip it somewhere convenient.
  - Open the sample project in the Unity editor.
    - Select the `File > Open Project` menu item.
    - Click `Open`.
    - Navigate to the sample directory `testapp` in the file dialog and click
      `Open`.
  - Open the scene `MainScene`.
    - Navigate to `Assets/Firebase/Sample/RemoteConfig` in the `Project` window.
    - Double click on `MainScene` file to open.
  - Import the `Firebase Remote Config` plugin.
    - Select the `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package` menu item.
    - Import `FirebaseRemoteConfig.unitypackage` from the
      [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity),
      downloaded previously.
    - Click the `Import` when the `Import Unity Package` window appears.
  - Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the project.
    - Navigate to the `Assets/Firebase/Sample/RemoteConfig` folder in the
      `Project` window.
    - Drag the `GoogleService-Info.plist` downloaded from the Firebase console
      into the folder.
      - NOTE: `GoogleService-Info.plist` can be placed anywhere under the
        `Assets` folder.
  - Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier
    - If you did not use `com.google.firebase.unity.remoteconfig.testapp`
      as the project package name you will need to update the sample's Bundle
      Identifier.
      - Select the `File > Build Settings` menu option.
      - Select `iOS` in the `Platform` list.
      - Click `Player Settings`
      - In the `Player Settings` panel scroll down to `Bundle Identifier`
        and update the value to the package name you provided when you
        registered your app with Firebase.
  - Build for iOS
    - Select the `File > Build Settings` menu option.
    - Select `iOS` in the `Platform` list.
    - Click `Switch Platform` to select `iOS` as the target platform.
    - Wait for the spinner (compiling) icon to stop in the bottom right corner
      of the Unity status bar.
    - Click `Build and Run`.
  - See the *Using the Sample* section below.


### Android

  - Register your Android app with Firebase.
    - Create a project in the
      [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      and attach your Android app to it.
      - You should use `com.google.firebase.unity.remoteconfig.testapp` as the
        package name while you're testing.
        - If you do not use the prescribed package name you will need to update
          the bundle identifier as described in the
          `Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier` below.

      - To [generate a SHA1](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth),
        first you will need to set the keystore in the Unity project.
        - Locate the `Publishing Settings` under `Player Settings`.
        - Select an existing keystore, or create a new keystore using the toggle.
        - Select an existing key, or create a new key using "Create a new key".
      - After setting the keystore and key, you can generate a SHA1 by
        running this command:
        ```
        keytool -exportcert -list -v -alias <key_name> -keystore <path_to_keystore>
        ```
    - Download the `google-services.json` file associated with your
        Firebase project from the console.
        This file identifies your Android app to the Firebase backend, and will
        need to be included in the sample later.
      - For further details please refer to the
        [general instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
        which describes how to configure a Firebase application for Android.
  - Download the
    [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity)
    and unzip it somewhere convenient.
  - Open the sample project in the Unity editor.
    - Select the `File > Open Project` menu item.
    - Click `Open`.
    - Navigate to the sample directory `testapp` in the file dialog and click
      `Open`.
  - Open the scene `MainScene`.
    - Navigate to `Assets/Firebase/Sample/RemoteConfig` in the `Project` window.
    - Double click on `MainScene` file to open.
  - Import the `Firebase Remote Config` plugin.
    - Select the `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package` menu item.
    - Import `FirebaseRemoteConfig.unitypackage` from the
      [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity),
    - Click the `Import` when the `Import Unity Package` window appears.
  - Add the `google-services.json` file to the project.
    - Navigate to the `Assets/Firebase/Sample/RemoteConfig` folder in the
      `Project` window.
    - Drag the `google-services.json` downloaded from the Firebase console
      into the folder.

        folder.
  - Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier
    - If you did not use `com.google.firebase.unity.remoteconfig.testapp`
      as the project package name you will need to update the sample's Bundle
      Identifier.

## Using the Sample

Before running, you should add some data to the Firebase Console for the
sample to fetch.

  - Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
  - Select your project.
  - Click on `Remote Config` in the sidebar.
  - Add the following parameters for the sample to fetch:
    - A string named `config_test_string`
    - An integer named `config_test_int`
    - A floating point value named `config_test_float`
    - A boolean named `config_test_bool`
  - Click `Publish` in the upper right corner.

The sample provides a simple interface with two buttons:
  - The `Fetch Remote Data` button fetches remote configuration data from the
    server.
  - The `Display Current Data` button displays the data fetched from the last
    press of the `Fetch Remote Data` button.  If data hasn't been fetch from
    the server or the server isn't accessible (e.g the device is offline)
    the default values set in `UIHandler.cs` will be displayed.
  - The `Display All Keys` button displays all of the keys associated with
    config data from the last fetch. It then displays all keys that begin with
    "config_test_s".

Using Firebase Remote Config you can update and publish new data through the
Firebase Console and it will be reflected in your app.
