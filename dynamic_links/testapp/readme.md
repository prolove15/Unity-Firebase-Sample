# Firebase Dynamic Links Quickstart

The Firebase Dynamic Links Unity Sample demonstrates sending and
receiving
[Firebase Dynamic Links](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/)
using the
[Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup).


## Requirements

* [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) 5.3 or higher.
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 9.4.1 or higher
  (when developing for iOS).
* [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads)
  (when developing for Android).


## Building the Sample

### iOS

  - Register your iOS app with Firebase.
    - Create a project in the
      [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      and associate your iOS application.
      - You should use `com.google.FirebaseUnityDynamicLinksTestApp.dev` as the
        package name while you're testing.
        - If you do not use the prescribed package name you will need to update
          the bundle identifier as described in the
          `Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier` below.
    - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file associated with your
      Firebase project from the console.
      This file identifies your iOS app to the Firebase backend, and will
      need to be included in the sample later.
    - For further details please refer to the
      [general instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
      which describes how to configure a Firebase application for iOS.
  - Download the
    [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity)
    and unzip it somewhere convenient.
  - Open the sample project in the Unity editor.
    - Select the `File > Open Project` menu item.
    - Click `Open`.
    - Navigate to the sample directory `testapp` in the file dialog and click
      `Open`.
  - Open the scene `MainScene`.
    - Navigate to `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Functions` in the `Project` window.
    - Double click on `MainScene` file to open.
  - Import the `Firebase Dynamic Links` plugin.
    - Select the `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package` menu item.
    - Import `FirebaseDynamicLinks.unitypackage` from the
      [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity),
      downloaded previously.
    - Click the `Import` when the `Import Unity Package` window appears.
  - Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the project.
    - Navigate to the `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Functions` folder in the `Project`
      window.
    - Drag the `GoogleService-Info.plist` downloaded from the Firebase console
      into the folder.
      - NOTE: `GoogleService-Info.plist` can be placed anywhere under the
        `Assets` folder.
  - Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier
    - If you did not use `com.google.FirebaseUnityDynamicLinksTestApp.dev`
      as the project package name you will need to update the sample's Bundle
      Identifier.
      - Select the `File > Build Settings` menu option.
      - Select `iOS` in the `Platform` list.
      - Click `Player Settings`
      - In the `Player Settings` panel scroll down to `Bundle Identifier`
        and update the value to the package name you provided when you
        registered your app with Firebase.
  - Copy the dynamic links domain for your project under the Dynamic Links
    tab of the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/)
    e.g xyz.app.goo.gl and assign it to the string DynamicLinksDomain on
    the UIHandler object in the MainScene.
  - Build for iOS
    - Select the `File > Build Settings` menu option.
    - Select `iOS` in the `Platform` list.
    - Click `Switch Platform` to select `iOS` as the target platform.
    - Wait for the spinner (compiling) icon to stop in the bottom right corner
      of the Unity status bar.
    - Click `Build and Run`.
  - Configure the iOS project capabilities to send invites and receive links.
    - Enable the Keychain Sharing capability on iOS 10 or above (required by
      Google Sign-In to send invites).
      You can enable this capability on your project in Xcode 8 by going to
      your project's settings, Capabilities, and turning on Keychain Sharing.
    - Copy the dynamic links domain for your project under the Dynamic Links
      tab of the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/)
      Then, in your project's Capabilities tab:
      - Enable the Associated Domains capability.
      - Add applinks:YOUR_DYNAMIC_LINKS_DOMAIN
        For example "applinks:xyz.app.goo.gl".
  - See the *Using the Sample* section below.


### Android

  - Register your Android app with Firebase.
    - Create a project in the
      [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      and attach your Android app to it.
      - You should use `com.google.FirebaseUnityDynamicLinksTestApp.dev` as the
        package name while you're testing.
        - If you do not use the prescribed package name you will need to update
          the bundle identifier as described in the
          `Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier` below.

      - To [generate a SHA1](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth),
        first you will need to set the keystore in the Unity project.
        - Locate the `Publishing Settings` under `Player Settings`.
        - Select an existing keystore, or create a new keystore using the toggle.
        - Select an existing key, or create a new key using "Create a new key".
      - After setting the keystore and key, you can generate a SHA1 by
        running this command:
        ```
        keytool -exportcert -list -v -alias <key_name> -keystore <path_to_keystore>
        ```
    - Download the `google-services.json` file associated with your
        Firebase project from the console.
        This file identifies your Android app to the Firebase backend, and will
        need to be included in the sample later.
      - For further details please refer to the
        [general instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)

    - Navigate to the `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Functions` folder in the `Project`
      window.
    - Drag the `google-services.json` downloaded from the Firebase console
      into the folder.

## Using the Sample

  - Receiving a link
    - When you first run the app, it will check for an incoming dynamic link
      and report whether it was able to fetch a link.
    - To simulate receiving a dynamic link, you can send yourself an email,
      uninstall the test app, then click the link in your email.
    - This would normally send you to the Play Store or App Store to download
      the app. Because this is a test app, it will link to a nonexistent store
      page.
    - After clicking the dynamic link, re-install and run the app on your
      device or emulator, and see the dynamic link fetched on the receiving
      side.
  - Creating a link
    - Clicking the Display Long Link button creates and displays a long
      dynamic link.
    - Clicking the Create Short Link button creates and displays a short link by
      contacting the link shortening service.
    - Clicking the Create Unguessable Short Link button creates and displays an
      unguessable short link.
